# Preview Generation System - Implementation Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. **Preview Generation Middleware**
- **File**: `/src/middleware/previewGeneration.middleware.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Supports image resizing and text-to-image conversion
  - Encrypts and compresses preview files using AES and Huffman compression
  - Stores previews in separate `previews` folder under user directories
  - Uses same storage key for both original files and previews
  - Exports utility functions: `getPreviewBuffer`, `previewExists`, `deletePreview`

### 2. **File Service Updates**
- **File**: `/src/api/file/file.service.ts`
- **Updates**:
  - Modified `processUploadedFiles` to accept `previewResults` parameter
  - Updated `createFileWithVirtualFolder` to handle `hasPreview` field
  - Added `getPreviewStream` method for serving encrypted/compressed previews
  - **Enhanced `permanentDeleteFile`** to delete associated previews using `deletePreview()` utility
  - **Enhanced `permanentDeleteAllDeletedFiles`** to delete previews for all deleted files

### 3. **File Controller Updates**
- **File**: `/src/api/file/file.controller.ts`
- **Updates**:
  - Integrated preview generation middleware into upload pipeline
  - Added `viewPreview` endpoint for serving preview files
  - Updated `processUploadedFiles` call to include preview results

### 4. **File Routes Updates**
- **File**: `/src/api/file/file.routes.ts`
- **Updates**:
  - Added `/:id/preview` route for accessing file previews

### 5. **Folder Service Updates**
- **File**: `/src/api/folder/folder.service.ts`
- **Updates**:
  - **Enhanced `permanentDeleteFolder`** to use `fileService.permanentDeleteFile()` instead of `fileDao.permanentDeleteFile()`
  - This ensures that when folders are permanently deleted, all contained files and their previews are properly cleaned up

### 6. **Upload Pipeline Integration**
The complete upload pipeline now includes:
```
upload.array("files") → 
encryptFiles → 
processZipFiles → 
generatePreviews → 
updateUserStorageUsage
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Preview Generation
- **Supported file types**: Images (jpg, png, gif, etc.) and text files (txt, md, json, etc.)
- **Storage**: Previews stored in `uploads/user-{userId}/previews/` with same storage key as original
- **Security**: All previews are encrypted with AES and compressed with Huffman compression
- **Database**: `hasPreview` boolean field tracks which files have previews

### Preview Deletion
- **Individual file deletion**: `permanentDeleteFile()` now deletes associated previews
- **Bulk deletion**: `permanentDeleteAllDeletedFiles()` deletes previews for all deleted files
- **Folder deletion**: `permanentDeleteFolder()` properly deletes previews for all contained files
- **Utility function**: `deletePreview()` provides reusable preview deletion logic

### Preview Access
- **Endpoint**: `GET /files/:id/preview`
- **Security**: Verifies file ownership before serving previews
- **Streaming**: Decrypts and streams preview files with proper headers
- **Caching**: Sets appropriate cache headers for browser optimization

## Directory Structure

```
uploads/
  user-{userId}/
    files/           # Original encrypted files
      {storageKey}
    previews/        # Encrypted and compressed previews
      {storageKey}   # Same key as original file
    temp/            # Temporary files for processing
```

## API Endpoints

### File Upload
```http
POST /files/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Files with supported types will automatically have previews generated
# Response includes hasPreview: true/false for each file
```

### Preview Access
```http
GET /files/:id/preview
Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Returns the preview file with appropriate Content-Type
# 404 if no preview exists or file not found
```

### File Deletion
```http
DELETE /files/:id/permanent
Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Now automatically deletes associated preview if it exists
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Preview Generation
1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Upload supported files (txt, jpg, png, etc.) via API
3. Check database to verify `hasPreview` field is set correctly
4. Verify preview files are created in `uploads/user-{userId}/previews/`

### 2. Test Preview Access
1. Upload a file that generates a preview
2. Note the file ID from the response
3. Access preview via `GET /files/{id}/preview`
4. Verify preview is served correctly with appropriate headers

### 3. Test Preview Deletion
1. Upload files with previews
2. Permanently delete individual files via `DELETE /files/{id}/permanent`
3. Verify both original file and preview are deleted
4. Test bulk deletion via emptying trash
5. Test folder deletion with files that have previews

### 4. Test Error Handling
1. Try accessing preview for file without preview (should return 404)
2. Try accessing preview for non-existent file (should return 404)
3. Try accessing preview without proper authentication (should return 401)

## Implementation Notes

### Security
- All previews are encrypted using the same user-specific key as original files
- Previews are compressed to save storage space
- Access control ensures users can only access their own file previews

### Performance
- Preview generation is asynchronous and doesn't block file upload response
- Generated previews are cached until file deletion
- Streaming implementation minimizes memory usage for large previews

### Error Handling
- Preview generation failures don't prevent file upload success
- Missing preview files are handled gracefully
- Deletion failures are logged but don't prevent database cleanup

The preview generation system is now fully integrated and provides comprehensive support for generating, accessing, and cleaning up file previews while maintaining security and performance standards.
